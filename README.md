# Threejs
These examples (with modification) come from the course '3D Programming with JavaScript and the Three.js 3D Library' by Shay Tavor at Udemy.com. While I was learning the course I decided to upload as I learn.

To try these examples simply download the Threejs folder and open the index.html in your favorite IDE. Change the src of the script tag in the body to whichever example you wish.

```html
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Normal Materials</title>
        <script src="three.min.js"></script>
        <style> body { margin: 0; } </style>
    </head>
    <body>
        <script src="YourExample.js"></script>
    </body>
</html>
```
